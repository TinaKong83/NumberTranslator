# Final Project Development
Week 1
- Used ofxGUI library to create pop up window with welcome message.
- Added ofSoundPlayer to allow mp3 file to play continuously in the background
- Need to add Naive Bayes code and figure out how to process drawn digit as pixels to be classified

Week 2
- Added rounded rectangles as buttons that will represent languages you wish to translate the number into(e.g. English)
- Added drawing tool that allows you to draw black lines in a continuous motion
- Saves a user-inputted drawing as a png file
- Added Naive Bayes code
- For next week, will need to work on debugging algorithm to correctly classify the image and display the image. I will also work on downloading the proper mp3 files corresponding to each language/number

Week 3
- Finished debugging Naive Bayes code so that when the user draws a number, it (sometimes) plays an audio clip of the correct English translation
- Added audio clips of english translations for all possible numbers
- Modifieed language button GUI to change color when the language is selected
- Upcoming goal: Add audio clips for other language options (e.g. French, Spanish), add image loading feature to show the pronunciation/appearance of a translaated number
- Upcoming goal (if time remains): Improve the line drawing tool by using ofBook instead, to allow erasing and multiple strokes
- Upcoming goal (if time remains): Cut down on the Naive Bayes Algorithm runtime
